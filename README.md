Dietemna is a atmospheric horror game inspired by P.T 
were you are stuck in a submarine deep down in the ocean.

This project was made in 5 mounths in a team of 5 students. 

During this project, I learned a lot about Unreal 5, it's optimisation
and workflow. I did some BluePrint but my main role was 3D-Modeler, 
Environment-Artist, Level-Designer, VFX-Artist, Tech-Artist, support Concept-Artist
